# Number-Guesser
Welcome to the Number Guesser Game!

This is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. The user has 5 chances to guess the correct number.

To run the program, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and navigate to the directory where the program is located. Run the command python number_guesser.py to start the game.

The program will prompt the user to enter their guess. If the guess is incorrect, the program will tell the user whether the correct number is higher or lower than their guess. The user has 5 chances to guess the correct number. If the user runs out of chances, the program will reveal the correct number and end the game.

Good luck!
